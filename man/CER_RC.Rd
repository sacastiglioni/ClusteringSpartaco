\title{Classification Error Rate (CER)}
\usage{
CER_RC(reference, estimate)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference}{the vector containing the reference classification.}

\item{estimate}{the vector containing the estimated classification.}
}
\value{
The function returns the CER. The closer is the value to 0,
the better is the estimated classification with respect to the reference one.
}
\description{
This function returns the classification error rate (CER, *Witten and Tibshirani, 2010*) as a measure of the discrepancy between a reference classification and an estimated classification.

\examples{
a <- c(1, 0, 0, 1, 1)
b <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1)
CER(a, b)
